Though sadly no longer available, J.E.M. was a small home furnishing and interior design firm in Boston's South End.

## The approach

Predating Wordpress's ascendance from blogging platform to fully-fledged CMS, this was my first deliverable Drupal site for a client and, to this day, I still wish it were available to view. For my part, this served as an introduction to implementing dynamic content, views, and highly structured content types for an editor without a technical background. The work of both the client and the designer are each right up my alley and I'm grateful to have played a small part.

Also, allow me to add that I sincerely miss being able to integrate a Facebook feed via RSS, without authentication or registering an application. Admittedly, I do not miss SimplePie, however.

## Trivia

To create the abstract backgrounds, the designer, [Anya Vedmid](http://anyavedmid.com), put physical objects from the store on a flatbed scanner to add a sense of depth.
