The MIT Museum engages the wider community with MIT’s science, technology, and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century. As the world's window into the work being done every day at MIT, the engagement caused a lot of excitement and provided a chance to put MIT's Drupal Cloud offering through its paces.

-----------------

## The approach

One of the fundamental requirements was that the new site had to be hosted on MIT's [Drupal Cloud](http://drupalcloud.mit.edu/)—a free, university-wide managed Drupal platform. That one caveat proved both really exciting and also an enormous challenge. The Museum site is, in many ways, fundamentally unlike all the other Drupal work I've done since version 4.x in that I had to work with an existing theme instead of making my own. Though the CSS and JS injectors are rather cunning and quite powerful, creating an entirely new process to build a design-lead site within the framework was a bit of a challenge. While I modified my existing workflow to help generate the styles and scripts for the injectors, there's arguably not a single line of code involved in generating that site—it's all varying degrees of "configuration."

Ultimately it proved worthwhile. The end result stands in rather stark contrast to any other site created on the platform and was a valuable (if occasionally humbling) experience.
