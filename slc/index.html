<h2>The approach</h2>
<p>With a capable and well-supported Cascade installation in place and internal resources to handle the implementation and ongoing support, my role on the Sarah Lawrence website was to deliver front end markup, styles, and scripts, while acting as the primary technical contact for scope and implementation considerations.</p>
<p>The display layer is crafted based upon my own customized Twitter Bootstrap rendering processâ€”through which we import source files and they are used to apply the same, well known and tested properties to selectors matching the otherwise custom site-wide markup. Doing so allowed me to take on a pivotal role in the information architecture of the site by providing direct, actionable feedback about responsive breakpoints and content hierarchies. In doing so, we created a structure through which the depth and breadth of the site's contents would be readily available and, from the first viewing of the first wireframes, everyone internally and on the client team was on the same page regarding responsive behavior.</p>
<p>To create the markup for delivery, I created a Grunt-based, flat file JSON database schema, templated using Mustache. The end result was a flexible site builder, allowing the entire team of four developers to work collaboratively to meet a tight deadline and vast range of page types and content models. The SVG icon implementation, built off a modified version of Grunticon, was also a notable addition since we needed to incorporate a rapidly evolving icon system and collaborate closely with the design team to retain consistent specifications.</p>
