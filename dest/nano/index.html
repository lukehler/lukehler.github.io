<p>MIT.nano is the collective name for MIT's cross-disciplinary nanotechnology and nanoscience fabrication laboratory, which is currently under construction right in the heart of campus. In addition to being one of the highest priorities for President L. Rafael Reif and the Deans of the Schools of Science and Engineering, the construction project is also a massive disruption to the flow of traffic through campus and the site had to serve as the source for logistical news amongst the community, as well as a broader outreach and advocacy role.</p>

<h2>The approach</h2>
<p>With a clear mandate from MIT leadership to make the site available immediately and a single designer and myself at the helm, we went from an introductory kickoff meeting to a live, custom Drupal site in approximately 5 weeks. Given a bit of preparation and a sample of the printed communications the nano team had shared before kickoff, I actually created a fully-functional responsive Drupal wireframe in time for the initial discovery session. By doing so, we received relevant, direct, and exceedingly valuable feedback. Armed with that initial knowledge, we rapidly sped through a visual design process while simultaneously adding features identified during discovery.</p>
<p>The theme is, as always, a completely custom creation just for the nano team. I'm really pleased that this particular site ended up as one of the least Bootstrap-y of all the Bootstrap-based sites I've worked on. Kudos to <a href="http://abudnitz.com">Alex</a> on that one.</p>
<p>In the time since that initial launch, we've added a few other enhancements as a part of a second phaseâ€“including a completely automated feed of all nanoscience and nanotechnology articles published by the MIT News Office, seamlessly integrated into their existing manually curated news content. Overall, however, the site has remained relatively unchanged and has not only been their primary logistical source for both relaying the impact of the construction to the MIT community but also acting as an outreach and platform for fundraising and awareness.</p>
