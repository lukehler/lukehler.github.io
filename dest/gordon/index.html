<p><em>created at Sametz Blackstone Associates</em></p>
<p>Gordon Brothers is a global financial services firm that specializes in valuations, dispositions, operations, and investments. With a reinvigorated brand strategy underway, the launch of the website was to serve as the centerpiece of a massive, global rollout.</p>

<h2>The approach</h2>
<p>With the client already invested heavily in Sitecore, we were engaged to deliver the front end only. As is often the case, we knew going in that we had minimal say over the final results and therefore had to try to ensure that the implementation team had sufficient flexibility to work with their platform.</p>
<p>The vast array of related content was systematized and standardized, to bring the whitepapers, insights, articles, case studies, projects, and people into a single modular framework while retaining their distinct field groups and appearance. The deeply comprehensive taxonomy was intended to power a dynamic faceted search engine.</p>
<p>Interaction was the key to encouraging acceptance amongst the client team. Though the design process had stalled over static images, building a working copy to demonstrate the responsive features and interaction turned out to be the impetus needed to proceed and put the project back on time and on budget.</p>
<p>Note that the final implementation involved a few alterations beyond the project as initially scoped. A copy of the original deliverable markup, styles, and scripts (my last direct involvement) is available upon request.</p>
